# Fetal-Health-Prediction-and-Optimization

This project aims to address the critical public health issue of fetal mortality by exploring the potential of Cardiotocography (CTG) data in predicting fetal health outcomes. The study utilizes a Kaggle dataset containing 22 CTG examination parameters. The analysis involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the implementation of machine learning models to answer key research questions with more focused hyper optimization utilizing automl and eli5 method.
